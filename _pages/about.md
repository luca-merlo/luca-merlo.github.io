I obtained my PhD in Methodological Statistics at the Sapienza University of Rome (Italy) with a thesis on quantile regression models for the analysis of multivariate data. I actively collaborate with national and international institutions, including the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (US), the University of Southampton (United Kingdom) and the University of Pisa (Italy). As of September 2022, I am a researcher in statistics at the European University of Rome (Italy). My research interests lie in quantile regression, latent variable models, finite mixture models with applications to longitudinal, time series and correlated data.

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
