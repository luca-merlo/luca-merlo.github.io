I obtained my PhD in Methodological Statistics at the <a href='https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home/'>Sapienza University of Rome</a> (Italy) with a thesis on quantile regression models for the analysis of multivariate data. I actively collaborate with national and international institutions, including the <a href='https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/'>Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health</a> (US), the <a href='https://www.southampton.ac.uk/'> University of Southampton</a> (United Kingdom) and the <a href='https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english'>University of Pisa</a> (Italy). From 2022 to 2024 I was a researcher in statistics at the European University of Rome (Italy). As of November, I am Associate Professor of Statistics at the Link Campus University in Rome (Italy). My research interests lie in quantile regression, latent variable models, finite mixture models with applications to longitudinal, time series and correlated data.
